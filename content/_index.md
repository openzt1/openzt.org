OpenZT is a project two years in the making. Our goals for now are simple: finish phase 1 of the roadmap, which includes lua scripting support so that you can find new ways to mod the game, bug fixes, and a mod manager to make it easier to install and manage mods. Join us on Discord to help us test the game and report bugs, or just to chat with other players and developers.
